Run two Docker containers app1 and app2 with the following attributes:
they should run image nginx:alpine
they should share the same PID kernel namespace
they should run command sleep infinity
they should run in the background (detached)
Then check which container sees which processes and make sense of why.

Answer

Run first container

pwd

We only see the processes of container app1

docker exec app1 ps aux

Run second container in first containers PID namespace

docker run --name app2 --pid=container:app1 -d nginx:alpine sleep infinity

We see processes of both containers in both containers

docker exec app1 ps aux
docker exec app2 ps aux
